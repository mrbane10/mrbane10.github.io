I’m a 2025 graduate from the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, specializing in **Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Large Language Models**. My work focuses on **agentic AI systems, multilingual LLM adaptation, retrieval-augmented generation, and efficient training techniques**. I enjoy building end-to-end ML applications—ranging from **from-scratch Transformer architectures** to **scalable RAG systems** deployed in production-like environments.  
You can explore my work in detail on my [GitHub](https://github.com/mrbane10).
